### To-Do List and Note-Taking App Repository

Welcome to my repository dedicated to storing the final projects for various tasks assigned to me by my instructor. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python scripts representing two distinct applications: a To-Do List application and a Note-Taking application. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of each project along with instructions on how to use them effectively.

### To-Do List Application

#### Description:
The To-Do List application is a command-line utility designed to assist users in managing their tasks efficiently. It provides functionalities such as adding tasks, updating task priorities, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, searching for specific tasks, displaying the entire to-do list, and saving the to-do list to a file.

#### Features:
- **Add Task:** Users can add a new task to the to-do list by providing the task name, priority level (high, medium, or low), and the current date. The status of the task is automatically set to "pending."
- **Update Priority:** Users can update the priority level of an existing task by specifying the task name and the new priority level.
- **Mark Task as Complete:** Users can mark a task as complete by specifying the task name. The status of the task is updated to "completed."
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete a specific task from the to-do list by specifying the task name.
- **Save To-Do List:** Users can save the entire to-do list to a file in JSON format, which can be loaded later for future reference.
- **Search Task:** Users can search for a specific task by entering its name. If the task exists in the to-do list, its details are displayed.
- **Display To-Do List:** Users can view the entire to-do list along with the task names, priorities, and statuses.

#### Usage:
To run the To-Do List application, execute the Python script in your preferred environment. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the menu and utilize the various functionalities offered by the application.

### Note-Taking App

#### Description:
The Note-Taking App is a simple yet powerful utility for creating, storing, and managing notes efficiently. It allows users to create new notes, view existing notes, update note contents, delete notes, and search for specific notes.

#### Features:
- **Create New Note:** Users can create a new note by providing a title and content for the note. The note is then saved to a designated folder for future reference.
- **View Notes List:** Users can view the list of all available notes, displaying only their titles.
- **Select Note to Open:** Users can select a specific note to open and view its title and content.
- **Update Note:** Users can update the content of an existing note by specifying the note title and entering the new content.
- **Delete Note:** Users can delete a specific note from the collection by specifying its title.
- **Search Note:** Users can search for a note by entering either the full title or a partial title. Any matching notes will be displayed.
- **Save Notes:** All notes are automatically saved to a designated folder upon creation or modification.

#### Usage:
To run the Note-Taking App, execute the Python script in your preferred environment. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various actions such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting notes, as well as searching for specific notes.

### Additional Notes:
Both the To-Do List application and the Note-Taking App serve as fundamental implementations of their respective functionalities. They can be further extended or modified to incorporate additional features based on specific requirements or user preferences. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with new functionalities, and adapt them to suit your needs.

For any inquiries, feedback, or suggestions regarding these projects, please feel free to reach out. Your input is highly appreciated and valuable for future improvements. Thank you for exploring my repository!
